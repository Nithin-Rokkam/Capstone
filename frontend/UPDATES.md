# Website Updates - October 29, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Scrolling Issue ✅
**Problem**: Unable to scroll on any page of the website.

**Root Cause**: The old `App.css` file had `overflow: hidden` on the body element, which prevented scrolling across the entire application.

**Solution**: 
- Removed all old styles from `App.css` that were causing conflicts
- Added `scroll-behavior: smooth` to the HTML element for better UX
- Each page now uses its own CSS file without global overflow restrictions

**Files Modified**:
- `src/App.css` - Cleaned up to remove conflicting styles
- `src/index.css` - Added smooth scrolling behavior

### 2. Hero Visual Replacement ✅
**Problem**: Floating cards on the right side of the landing page needed to be replaced with a more representative image.

**Solution**: 
- Replaced the three animated floating cards with a custom SVG illustration
- Created a newspaper/document stack with AI brain icon
- Represents the core concept: News + AI-powered recommendations
- Maintains the minimal black and white theme
- Added subtle floating animation for visual interest

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/LandingPage.jsx` - Replaced hero visual JSX
- `src/pages/LandingPage.css` - Updated styles for new illustration

## New Hero Visual Design

The new illustration features:
- **Newspaper Stack**: Represents news articles and content
- **Content Lines**: Shows article text and structure
- **AI Brain Icon**: Black circle with eyes and smile representing AI
- **Sparkles/Stars**: Indicates intelligent processing
- **Floating Animation**: Smooth 6-second up-and-down motion
- **Drop Shadow**: Subtle depth effect

### Design Specifications
- **Colors**: Black (#000000), White (#FFFFFF), Gray (#f8f8f8, #e5e5e5)
- **Size**: Responsive, max-width 500px
- **Animation**: 6s ease-in-out infinite float
- **Style**: Minimal, clean, professional

## Testing

All pages now scroll properly:
- ✅ Landing Page (`/`)
- ✅ Sign In Page (`/signin`)
- ✅ Sign Up Page (`/signup`)
- ✅ Dashboard (`/dashboard`)

## Development Server

The development server is running with Hot Module Replacement (HMR):
- **URL**: http://localhost:5174
- **Status**: Active
- **Auto-reload**: Enabled

Changes are automatically reflected in the browser without manual refresh.

## Next Steps

1. **Test all pages** - Navigate through the entire website
2. **Check responsiveness** - Test on different screen sizes
3. **Verify scrolling** - Ensure smooth scrolling on all pages
4. **Review visual** - Confirm the new hero illustration looks good

## Notes

- The old `App.css` styles were for a split-panel layout that's no longer used
- Each page component now has its own dedicated CSS file
- Global styles are minimal and only in `index.css`
- The new routing structure (React Router) is cleaner and more maintainable
